****	Finish porting to Windows (should be only file.c and args.c, I think)

**	BUG: Rocks can be created touching, often giving a high-velocity bounce.

***	Add a scripting language and separate game logic from the engine.
	Forth?  Scheme?  Lua?

**	Switch to a TTF font and all ray-traced graphics
*	Then we can run at the native screen size

*	Deltas on high score display?
