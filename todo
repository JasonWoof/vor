****	Finish porting to Windows (should be only file.c and args.c, I think)

**	BUG: Rocks can be created touching, often giving a high-velocity bounce.

***	Move game logic into a script so we can have "variations".
*	Then an in-game menu to choose which game.

**	Switch to a TTF font and all ray-traced graphics
*	Then we can run at the native screen size

*	Deltas on high score display?


Comments from HappyPenguin (and solution ideas by Josh)

***	Too hard: should be able to choose difficulty from within game.
**	What do you do at game over?  "Press SPACE to start a new game".
**	Multiple deaths is a problem: fade new ship in? [DONE 2006-03-24]
**	Why can't you go left?  You're trying to outrun a blast wave.
