****	Finish porting to Windows (should be only file.c and args.c, I think)

**	BUG: Rocks can be created touching, often giving a high-velocity bounce.

***	Move game logic into a script so we can have "variations".
*	Then an in-game menu to choose which game.

**	Switch to a TTF font and all ray-traced graphics

*	Deltas on high score display?


Comments from HappyPenguin (and solution ideas by Josh)

**	What do you do at game over?  Need an explanatory message.
**	Why can't you go left?  Blast wave.  Fire/explosion graphics?
