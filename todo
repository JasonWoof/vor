****	Finish porting to Windows (should be only file.c and args.c, I think)

***	Move game logic into a script so we can have "variations".
*	Then an in-game menu to choose which game:
	Rock Dodger
	Free-form/Practice
	Crazy Taxi
*	Add networking for multiplayer games:
	Tag
	Deathmatch

**	Switch to a scalable font and all ray-traced graphics
*	Then we can run at the native screen size

*	BUG: Rocks can be created touching, causing a high-velocity bounce.

*	Deltas on high score display?


Comments from HappyPenguin (and solution ideas by Josh)

**	Why can't you go left?  Blast wave.  Fire/explosion graphics?

***	Too hard.  Add easy setting (press 'e' to start easy game).
**	What do you do at game over?  Need an explanatory message.
