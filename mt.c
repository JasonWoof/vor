/* mt.c - A C program for MT199937, with initialization improved 2002-02-10.

   -----
   2006-01-14 - Switched include from stdint.h to inttypes.h,
   fixed a warning from gcc -Wall.  --Josh
   -----
   2003-07-01 - Stripped out stuff I didn't need, converted to
   stdint.h types, changed source formatting a bit.  --Josh

   A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002-02-10.
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
   This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
   Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.

   Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed) 
   or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
