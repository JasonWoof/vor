REQUIREMENTS

	vor requires the following libraries to build/run:
		sdl           http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
		sdl_mixer     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
		sdl_image     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
	And the following to create the graphics:
		povray        http://www.povray.org/
		netpbm        http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/

BUILDING
	
	"cd" to the vor source directory and type "make" at the command prompt.

RUNNING

	"./vor"

	After building you should have an executable called "vor" in the
	current (source) directory. You can run this here, "./vor"

INSTALLING

	Just type "make install" at the command prompt.

	By default it puts executable in /usr/games/bin and the data in
	/usr/share/vor. If you'd like to change either, edit the Makefile
	before building. If you change these settings in the Makefile after
	building, you'll have to "make clean" and build again before
	installing.
