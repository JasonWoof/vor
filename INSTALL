Installation Instructions
=========================

Requirements
------------

vor requires the following libraries to build/run:

*	sdl           http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
*	sdl_mixer     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
*	sdl_image     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

If you are building from git, (or editing the graphics) you will also
need:

	autoconf      version 2.63 or greater

You'll also need the graphics (`data` subdir) from the tarbal, or the following
packages to render the graphics:

	povray        http://www.povray.org/
	netpbm        http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/


Building From A Release Tarball
-------------------------------

(See Building From Git below if you don't have a release tarball)

change to the source directory and run this:

./configure && make

Unless there are errors, you should be able to run the game from the
source directory like this:

./vor


Building From Git
-----------------

1.	Make sure you have the extra dependencies first. If you want to avoid
	installing povray and/or netpbm, you can simply copy the data/ directory
	from a recent release.

2.	Run "autoconf".

3.	Continue as normal with the Building From A Release Tarball section above.


Building For Windows
--------------------

These instructions should work on most any modern GNU/Linux system, and maybe
other Unix-like systems.

1.	Download MXE (and install its dependencies) by following just step 1 of
	this tutorial:

	http://mxe.cc/#tutorial
	
2.	`cd` into the `mxe` directory

3.	Run this: (takes some patience)

		make gcc

4.	Run this:

		make sdl-image sdl-mixer
	
5.	Set up your environment for cross-compiling:

		export PATH="/PATH/TO/YOUR/MXE/DIR/usr/bin:$PATH"

6.	`cd` to vor source directory.

7.	Build VoR with this command:

		./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32 && make


Running
-------

	You can run VoR from the source directory without installing it:

		./vor

	add `-h` to see commandline arguments.

	See `README` file for keys, etc.


Installing
----------

	You can run `make install` to install vor. If you're installing
	system-wide (for example, to the default install location of `/usr/local`)
	you'll need to run this as root.

	You can specify an alternative install location with the `--prefix=`
	argument to `./configure`. See the output of: `./configure --help` for more
	information.
