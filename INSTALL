REQUIREMENTS

	vor requires the following libraries to build/run:
		sdl           http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
		sdl_mixer     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
		sdl_image     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
	And the following to create the graphics:
		povray        http://www.povray.org/
		netpbm        http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/

BUILDING
	
	"cd" to the vor source directory and type "make" at the command prompt.

	For the brave: see also BUILDING ON WINDOWS below

RUNNING

	"./vor"

	After building you should have an executable called "vor" in the
	current (source) directory. You can run this here, "./vor"

INSTALLING

	Just type "make install" at the command prompt.

	By default it puts the executable in /usr/games/bin and the data in
	/usr/share/vor. If you'd like to change either, edit the Makefile
	before building. If you change these settings in the Makefile after
	building, you'll have to "make clean" and build again before
	installing.



BUILDING ON WINDOWS

	1) Grab a copy of the vor source code with the images already rendered. If
	you want to compile from the latest sources in the repository, you'll have
	to check out onto a unix machine, and "make data" to render the ships and
	rocks. The source tarballs usually have these rendered already.

	2) download sdl source from libsdl.org. follow these instructions to
	install msys, mingw, and sdl:

	http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/mingw32/README.txt

	stay in the shell for step 3:

	3) download, unpack and install sdl-mixer and sdl-image from source (should
	(I hope) work the same way as installing sdl in step 2 above.)

	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html

	4) run this command in the vor source directory: mingw-make -f Makefile.win
